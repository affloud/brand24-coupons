</a>

Brand24 tracks mentions of your brand, products, or keywords across the internet as they happen. This means you don’t have to wait to find out what people are saying. Whether it’s on social media, blogs, news sites, or forums, you get instant updates. This helps you act quickly if there’s important news or feedback.

**2. Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**

Not all mentions are the same. Brand24 uses artificial intelligence (AI) to figure out if a mention is positive, negative, or neutral. Beyond that, it can identify emotions like happiness, anger, or admiration in the comments. This helps you understand how people really feel about your brand, not just what they say.

**3. Influencer and Hashtag Tracking**

**5. Custom Reports and Alerts**

You can create detailed reports that show trends, sentiment, top influencers, and more. These reports can be exported as PDFs or Excel files and shared with your team or clients. You can also set up email alerts to get daily or weekly summaries or get notified when something important happens.

**6. AI Brand Assistant**
